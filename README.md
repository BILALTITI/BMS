Bank Management System (BMS)
Overview
The Bank Management System (BMS) is a desktop application designed for managing banking operations such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers between accounts. The system provides a simple user interface for managing accounts, performing financial transactions, and viewing account details.

This project is built using two different programming languages:

C# with the .NET Framework
C++ with the same functionality and features as the C# version
The system uses SQL for database management, with queries written in T-SQL for data retrieval and manipulation.

Technologies Used
C# (.NET Framework) for the primary version of the application.
C++ for an alternative version with the same core functionality.
SQL and T-SQL for database management.
Microsoft SQL Server for data storage.
Features
Account Management: Create, edit, and view bank accounts.
Withdrawal: Process withdrawals from customer accounts.
Deposit: Deposit money into customer accounts.
Fund Transfer: Transfer money between different accounts within the system.
Transaction History: View transaction records for each account.
Security: Password protection and user authentication for accessing the system.
